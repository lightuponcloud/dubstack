# DubStack

[![SWUbanner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vshymanskyy/StandWithUkraine/main/banner2-direct.svg)](https://github.com/vshymanskyy/StandWithUkraine/blob/main/docs/README.md)

This middleware is used to synchronize Riak CS contents with filesystem. Also it provides web UI for browsing files.

## What it can do

1. **File Synchronization**

    This is a server side of the file synchronization software.
    It allows not only file **upload**/**download**, but also file **lock**/**unlock**,
    **delete**/**undelete**, differential sync and automated conflict resolution.

2. **Simple authentication**

    Login/password and other credentials are stored in Riak CS bucket,
    called "security" and can be manipulated through web interface.

    You don't have to implement complex AWS ``vN`` signing algorithms.

3. **Action log and changelog**

    It records history of upload, copy, move, rename and delete operations.

4. **Provides web interface, Android application and synchronization client for Windows**

    You can manage objects, users, their groups and tenants using browser or Android App.

5. **Search**

    It has a simple Solr API implementation, allowing to index contents of uploaded objects.
    Since Yokozuna was removed from Riak CS, you will have to setup Solr and its schema manually.
    See [solr_schema.xml](doc/solr_schema.xml) and [solr_setup.txt](doc/solr_setup.txt).

6. **Readable URLs**

    It transliterates UTF8 object names. For example pseudo-directory
    ``"useful"`` will be encoded as ``"75736566756c/"`` prefix,
    file name ``"корисний.jpg"`` becomes object key ``"korisnii.jpg"``.

7. **Gallery, thumbnails, watermarks**

    Thumbnails are generated on demand by dedicated gen_server process.
    If it finds watermark.png in root of any bucket, it applies watermark on thumbnails.

    You can view the gallery by the link /riak/gallery/[:bucket_id]


## Why Riak CS

I used Riak CS as a main storage backend, as it is AWS S3 compatible and very predictable on resource consumption.
It has recovery tools, scales automatically, it can store files > 5 TB and has multi-datacenter bidirectional replication.
It was built using the latest academic research in the area of distributed systems.

## Advantages of DubStack

### 1. Simple Architecture

Erlang applications are much easier to maintain.

Typical setup:

Erlang web application:

### 2. Multi-tenant Setup

DubStack creates buckets with names of the following format.
```
<bucket prefix>-<user id>-<tenant id>-<bucket type>"
```
**bucket prefix** : A short string that can be used by reverse-proxy, such as Nginx:
```
location /the- {
    proxy_pass_header Authorization;
    ...
}
```

**user id** : Short string, that identifies User bucket created for.

**tenant id** : Short identifier of tenant ( aka project ).

**bucket type** : By default "res", -- restricted. Only users within the same tenant
can access restricted buckets. Other suffixes can be "public" or "private", but they
are not yet implemented.

## Installation

### Dependencies

* Erlang >= 23, < 25

* coreutils ( ``"/usr/bin/head"``, ``/bin/mktemp`` commands )

* imagemagick-6.q16

* libmagickwand-dev


#### 1. Build Riak CS

[See Riak CS Installation Manual](/doc/riak_cs_setup.md) for installation and configuration instructions.

#### 2. Build DubStack

Clone this repository and execute the following commands.
```sh
make fetch-deps
make deps
make
```

In order to use specific version of erlang, you should set environment variables 
*C_INCLUDE_PATH* and *LIBRARY_PATH*. For example:
```sh
export C_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/lib/erlang/usr/include:/usr/include/ImageMagick-6:/usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu/ImageMagick-6
export LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/erlang/usr/lib:/usr/include/ImageMagick-6
```

The following imagemagic packages are required:
imagemagick-6.q16 libmagickcore-6-arch-config libmagickwand-6.q16-dev

#### 3. Edit configuration files

You need to change ``riak_api_config`` in ``include/riak.hrl``.
Locate ``riak-cs.conf`` in Riak CS directory. Copy ``admin.key`` value from ``riak-cs.conf``
and paste it to ``access_key_id`` in ``riak_api_config``.

Then locate ``riak.conf`` in Riak directory and place value of ``riak_control.auth.user.admin.password``
to ``include/riak.hrl``, to the ``secret_access_key`` option.

In order to add first user, authentication should be temporary disabled.

Edit file ``include/riak.hrl`` and set ``ANONYMOUS_USER_CREATION`` to ``true``.

Then start DubStack by executing ``make run``.

#### 4. Add users

Create the first ``tenant``:
```sh
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1/riak/admin/tenants/" \
    -H "accept: application/json" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "{ \"name\": \"My Brand\", \"enabled\": \"true\", \"groups\": \"Engineers, Another Group\" }"
```

**Expected Response** :
```json
{
   "id":"mybrand",
   "name":"My Brand",
   "enabled":"true",
   "groups":[
      {
         "id":"engineers",
         "name":"Engineers"
      },
      {
         "id":"anothergroup",
         "name":"Another Group"
      }
   ]
}
```

Add the first ``user``:
```sh
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1/riak/admin/mybrand/users/" \
    -H "accept: application/json" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "{ \"name\": \"Joe Armstrong\", \"login\": \"ja@example.com\", \"password\": \"secret\", \"enabled\": \"true\", \"staff\": \"true\", \"groups\": \"engineers, anothergroup\" }"
```

**Expected Response** :
```json
{
   "id":"1fc069d1c19b47b4454f5673b25b653c",
   "name":"Joe Armstrong",
   "tenant_id":"mybrand",
   "tenant_name":"My Brand",
   "tenant_enabled":"true",
   "login":"ja@example.com",
   "enabled":"true",
   "staff":"true",
   "groups":[
      {
         "id":"engineers",
         "name":"Engineers",
         "available_bytes":-1,
         "bucket_id":"the-mybrand-engineers-res",
         "bucket_suffix":"res"
      },
      {
         "id":"anothergroup",
         "name":"Another Group",
         "available_bytes":-1,
         "bucket_id":"the-mybrand-anothergroup-res",
         "bucket_suffix":"res"
      }
   ]
}
```

Now you should change ``general_settings`` in ``include/general.hrl`` and set
``domain`` option to IP address or domain name that you use.
Otherwise login won't work.

Finally you should set ``ANONYMOUS_USER_CREATION`` to ``false``
and restart DubStack. 

You can login now using credentials of staff user that you have just created.
Staff user has permission to add other users.
